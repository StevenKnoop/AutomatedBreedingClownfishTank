# Automated Baby Clownfish Tank
Automate breeding clownfish and challanges

Good day **Ed** and friends.

I have a project I want to under take but require knowledge and assistance. Your help would be greatly appriceated.

# What is the project?
Breeding clownfish with automation.

## What needs to be automated:
1) Daily water changes 20% - 50%
2) Medicine dosage after each water change
3) Multiple Feedings per day (not required but nice to have)

## Challanges:
> How to remove water from the tank without sucking up baby fish(3mm in lenght). I have spoken to experts about this, they all do it manually, any fish they suck up will end up in bucket which gets removed and put back into the breding tank afterwards.

> Eskom(Power cuts for a fews hours a day, sometimes multiple times a day). Baby clownfish are extemely sensitive to changes. The Heater and LED needs to stay active for 30 days straight.

> How to automatically feed baby clown fish. (Will emphasize on this more soon)

> How to power/connect the pumps and the arudino. I think the pumps require too much power to run off the arudino. What kind of power supply do I need to power the pumps? How do I control the pumps with the arudino if they powered by another source. Is it possible to add this to the UPS or will it require too much power?
Note: Willing to buy different pump if needed.

## Equiptment and reason:
+ 50W heater
+ Diaphragm Pump EDLP 600 + Mount X 2 (Remove and insert water) https://www.robotics.org.za/KAM-EDLP600
+ Water Flow Rate Sensor YF-S401 X 2 (Accurate remove and insert the same amount of water) https://www.robotics.org.za/YF-S401
+ Tubing (water flow in and out, feeding and dosage)
+ Power supply (power the arduino + pumps)
+ Ardunio (to manage pump usage based on sensor readings)
+ Small/Soft LED (needs to run 24/7)
+ Small Battery backup inverter (Something aforable, a few ZAR grand at most.) LED light + small air pump 
+ Fish Stuff (None technical.)




## Available tools:
+ 3D printer (Ender 3 V2)
