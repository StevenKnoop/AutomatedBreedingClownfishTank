# Automated Breeding Clownfish Tank
Automate breeding clownfish and challenges

Good day, internet friends.

I have a project I want to undertake but require knowledge and assistance. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

# What is the project?
Breeding clownfish with automation.

# Background
Breeding clownfish is no easy task, it requires lots of manual labour to have a successful batch. For example, everyday one needs to clean the bottom of the tank to remove all the junk and dead ones. Note that the babies are TINY, only 3mm in length, so it requires a lot of attention to not siphon them out when cleaning or changing the water of the tank. If not removed, the amino will spike and all the fish will die. Then there is also the daily water changes(20% - 50%) as well as the multiple feeding per day. This goes on for about 30 days straight. What makes it even harder is the fact that these babies are extremely delicate. All movements and light needs to be slow or the babies will die from stress. 

## What needs to be automated:
1) Daily water changes 20% - 50%.
2) Daily cleaning of the bottom of the tank.
3) Medicine dosage after each water change.
4) Multiple feeding per day (not required but nice to have).

## Challenges:
> How to remove water from the tank without sucking up baby fish(3mm in lenght). I have spoken to experts about this, they all do it manually, any fish they suck up will end up in bucket which gets removed and put back into the breding tank afterwards.

> Eskom(Power cuts for a fews hours a day, sometimes multiple times a day). Baby clownfish are extemely sensitive to changes. The Heater, LED and air pump needs to stay active for 30 days straight.

> How to automatically feed baby clown fish. (Will emphasize on this more soon)

> How to power/connect the pumps and the arudino. I think the pumps require too much power to run off the arudino. What kind of power supply do I need to power the pumps? How do I control the pumps with the arudino if they powered by another source. Is it possible to add this to the UPS or will it require too much power?
Note: Willing to buy different pump if needed. I have this extra power supply but not sure if it enough, what do you think? https://www.robotics.org.za/LRS-35-12

## Equipment and reason:
+ 50W heater
+ Diaphragm Pump EDLP 600 + Mount X 2 (Remove and insert water) https://www.robotics.org.za/KAM-EDLP600
+ Water Flow Rate Sensor YF-S401 X 2 (Accurate remove and insert the same amount of water) https://www.robotics.org.za/YF-S401
+ Tubing (water flow in and out, feeding and dosage)
+ Power supply (power the Arduino + pumps)
+ Arduino (to manage pump usage based on sensor readings)
+ Small/Soft LED (needs to run 24/7)
+ Small Battery backup inverter (Something affordable, a few ZAR grand at most.) LED light + heater + air pump. 
+ Fish Stuff (None technical.)




## Available tools:
+ 3D printer (Ender 3 V2)
